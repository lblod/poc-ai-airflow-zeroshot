This repository contains the airflow code that is used for zero-shot classification. We use zero-shot classification to
link predefined taxonomies to files. These taxonomies are predefined yet adaptable string values, that will confidence score
for the relevance it has given a document.

A more indepth functionality guide can be found at the poc-ai-deployment repo.
